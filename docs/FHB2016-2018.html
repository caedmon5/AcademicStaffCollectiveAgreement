                           recognize that a central, defining responsibility of the University is
                           the creation and dissemination of new knowledge, and that this knowledge
                           stems from scholarly research into basic aspects of nature and other
                           forms of creative intellectual and artistic investigation. The Board and
                           the Association affirm that because this process of discovery is
                           supported by the citizens of Canada and Alberta, these citizens should
                           share in the benefits flowing from it. In all cases these benefits are
                           ultimately to be enjoyed by means of public exposition of new knowledge
                           or creative works through publications, presentations, exhibitions,
                           performances, or teaching. However, the benefits of research may also be
                           shared through commercialization or other means of transfer of
                           intellectual property, so long as this activity does not conflict with
                           the obligation of the University to generate and disseminate knowledge

            <p>Two members of academic staff of the University of Lethbridge serve as members of
                  the Board of Governors of the University of Lethbridge and thus serve the
                  University in two very important ways. </p>
            <p>Within the framework of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, the Board of Governors is
                  charged with establishing and implementing strategy, policy and governance and
                  with ensuring accountability to the people of Alberta. The members of academic
                  staff deliver the core academic mandate of the University in teaching, research
                  and scholarship, and service.</p>
            <p>The Board of Governors and the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association
                  recognize that it is possible for some ambiguity and potential conflict to occur
                  as members of academic staff perform their service as academic staff and as
                  governors. The following framework is intended to provide guidance in these
                  situations to members of academic staff serving on the Board, other Board members,
                  members of academic staff and administrators.</p>
            <p>The Board of Governors and the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association agree that:<ol>

                        is, members of academic staff serving as Board members retain all of the
                        rights and responsibilities of members of the academic staff including the
                        provisions of academic freedom, the right to question and criticize the
                        administration of the University, and the right to grieve violations of the

                        as Board members and Senior Academic Administrators, it is necessary for the
                        Board member and the administrator to be clear whether the Board member is
                        acting primarily as a member of the academic staff or as a governor. Where,
                        after consultation with the Member, the administrator remains uncertain as

                        or a member of the Board, the administrator may ask the Member to declare in
                        writing and in a timely manner the capacity in which he or she is

            <p> 2.1 The Faculty Association shall make a one-time payment of $20,000.00 towards
                  the construction costs of the day care facility which shall be paid by the Faculty
                  Association to the University on or before September 1, 2009. </p>
            <p> 2.2 The Faculty Association agrees that each member of the Faculty Association
                  will contribute the sum of $1.80 per month for each month that the individual is a

                  contributions to continue by Faculty Members for a period of 20 years following
                  the date the day care opens for operation. </p>
            <p> 2.3 In the event that the day care facility is not in operation due to the
                  absence of a day care provider prior to September 1, 2009, the individual monthly
                  contributions by member s of the Faculty Association shall be suspended for the
                  period during which the day care facility is not in operation commencing with the
                  month immediately following the month in which the day care operation was
                  suspended or discontinued with such contributions resuming with the month
                  following the month in which the day care facility recommences operation. </p>
            <p> 2.4 The Faculty Association agrees that the monthly contributions shall be
                  automatically deducted by the University from the remuneration paid to each
                  Faculty Member and on behalf of each Faculty Member hereby authorizes the
                  University to make such a deduction. In the event that an amendment to the
                  collective agreement between the University and the Faculty Association agree to
                  take such steps as may be required to give effect to these provisions, the
                  University and the Faculty Association agree to take such steps as may be required
                  to amend the collective agreement accordingly. </p>
            <p> 2.5 The faculty Association will provide annual input, by July of each year, to
                  the Vice-President (Finance and Administration) in relation to the annual
                  Landlord/Tenant review meetings on issues or recommendations related to the Day
                  Care Centre. </p>
            <p> 3. This Agreement shall endure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties
                  hereto and their respective successors and assigns. </p>

            <p>Further to agreement reached at bargaining in 2013, the parties agree that Members
                  shall complete a web-based Employee Declaration Disclosure Form (attached) for the
                  declaration of any conflict of interest and/or conflict of commitment. This
                  disclosure is made when the Member's appointment commences and annually thereafter
                  at the beginning of the calendar year. It replaces the paper declaration form
                  previously submitted with the Members annual Professional Activities Report.</p>
            <p>If at any time during the year, there is reasonable cause to believe that a
                  current or anticipated conflict of interest or commitment may exist (11.05.5), the
                  Member must disclose this to their Dean/University Librarian as soon as possible
                  after the Member becomes aware of it, and record it through the web-based form.
                  Notification of approval, if granted, will come through the web-based system from
                  the Associate Vice-President (Human Resources &amp; Administration) on behalf of
                  the Dean/University Librarian.</p>

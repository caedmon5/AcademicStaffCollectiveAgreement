               <hi>CODE OF CONDUCT BOARD OF GOVERNORS FACULTY REPRESENTATIVES</hi>
               <p>Two members of academic staff of the University of Lethbridge serve as members of
                  the Board of Governors of the University of Lethbridge and thus serve the
                  University in two very important ways. </p>
               <p>Within the framework of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, the Board of Governors is
                  charged with establishing and implementing strategy, policy and governance and
                  with ensuring accountability to the people of Alberta. The members of academic
                  staff deliver the core academic mandate of the University in teaching, research
                  and scholarship, and service.</p>
               <p>The Board of Governors and the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association
                  recognize that it is possible for some ambiguity and potential conflict to occur
                  as members of academic staff perform their service as academic staff and as
                  governors. The following framework is intended to provide guidance in these
                  situations to members of academic staff serving on the Board, other Board members,
                  members of academic staff and administrators.</p>
               <p>The Board of Governors and the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association agree that:<list>
                     <item n="H.01" xml:id="f-d1e3898">1. When they are acting in their capacity as
                        members of academic staff all of the relevant provisions of the Collective

                        is, members of academic staff serving as Board members retain all of the

               <p>THEREFORE the parties hereto agree as follows:</p>
               <p> 1. University Responsibilities:</p>
               <p> 1.1 University of Lethbridge will construct a day care facility on its Lethbridge

               <p> 1.2 The University of Lethbridge will contribute funding of at least 65% of the
                  capital costs for construction of the day care facility. </p>
               <p> 1.3 The University of Lethbridge will enter into a Lease with an external day
                  care provider which will include provisions to the following affect:</p>
               <p> a) The University as the Landlord will set the initial allocation of spaces for
                  children attending the day care between children of undergraduate students,
                  children of Member, children of graduate students, children of employees of the
                  day care provider and children of others, and shall have the exclusive right to
                  change the allocation of spaces with such change to be effective at the beginning
                  of the next academic semester;</p>
               <p> b) The Tenant shall agree to charge a reasonable and competitive day care fee for
                  the day care services provided which will be comparable to the fee charged by the
                  other day cares operating within the City of Lethbridge;</p>
               <p> c) The Tenant shall keep the Day Care Centre open for business and in normal
                  operation at least 10 hours per day, Monday to Friday inclusive, with the

                  closed.</p>
               <p> 2. Faculty Association Responsibilities:</p>
               <p> 2.1 The Faculty Association shall make a one-time payment of $20,000.00 towards
                  the construction costs of the day care facility which shall be paid by the Faculty

               <p> 2.2 The Faculty Association agrees that each member of the Faculty Association
                  will contribute the sum of $1.80 per month for each month that the individual is a

                  contributions to continue by Faculty Members for a period of 20 years following
                  the date the day care opens for operation. </p>
               <p> 2.3 In the event that the day care facility is not in operation due to the
                  absence of a day care provider prior to September 1, 2009, the individual monthly
                  contributions by member s of the Faculty Association shall be suspended for the
                  period during which the day care facility is not in operation commencing with the
                  month immediately following the month in which the day care operation was
                  suspended or discontinued with such contributions resuming with the month

                  automatically deducted by the University from the remuneration paid to each
                  Faculty Member and on behalf of each Faculty Member hereby authorizes the
                  University to make such a deduction. In the event that an amendment to the

                  University and the Faculty Association agree to take such steps as may be required
                  to amend the collective agreement accordingly. </p>
               <p> 2.5 The faculty Association will provide annual input, by July of each year, to
                  the Vice-President (Finance and Administration) in relation to the annual
                  Landlord/Tenant review meetings on issues or recommendations related to the Day
                  Care Centre. </p>

                  submitted to an arbitrator to determine their custody or control in accordance
                  with Article 22 of the University of Lethbridge Faculty Handbook.</p>

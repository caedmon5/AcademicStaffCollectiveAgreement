               <p>The common good of society depends upon the search for truth and its free
                  exposition. Academic freedom in both teaching and research is essential to these
                  purposes. Members are entitled to the freedom to carry out research and to publish
                  the results, to the freedom to teach and discuss their subjects, and to the
                  freedom from institutional censorship.</p>
               <p>Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a responsible
                  way.</p>

               <hi>CODE OF CONDUCT BOARD OF GOVERNORS FACULTY REPRESENTATIVES</hi>
               <p>Two members of academic staff of the University of Lethbridge serve as members of
                  the Board of Governors of the University of Lethbridge and thus serve the
                  University in two very important ways. </p>
               <p>Within the framework of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, the Board of Governors is
                  charged with establishing and implementing strategy, policy and governance and
                  with ensuring accountability to the people of Alberta. The members of academic
                  staff deliver the core academic mandate of the University in teaching, research
                  and scholarship, and service.</p>
               <p>The Board of Governors and the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association
                  recognize that it is possible for some ambiguity and potential conflict to occur
                  as members of academic staff perform their service as academic staff and as
                  governors. The following framework is intended to provide guidance in these
                  situations to members of academic staff serving on the Board, other Board members,
                  members of academic staff and administrators.</p>
               <p>The Board of Governors and the University of Lethbridge Faculty Association agree that:<list>
                     <item n="H.01" xml:id="f2016-d1e3898">1. When they are acting in their capacity
                        as members of academic staff all of the relevant provisions of the Faculty
                        Handbook apply to members of academic staff serving as Board members. That
                        is, members of academic staff serving as Board members retain all of the
                        rights and responsibilities of members of the academic staff including the
                        provisions of academic freedom, the right to question and criticize the
                        administration of the University, and the right to grieve violations of the
                        Faculty Handbook by the administration.</item>
                     <item n="H.02" xml:id="f2016-d1e3900">2. The governance documents of the Board
                        are: “Charter of Expectations for the Board of Governors”, “Code of Conduct
                        and Ethics for the Board of Governors”, “Terms of Reference for an
                        Individual Governor”, and “Rules of Operation of the Board of Governors”.
                        These governance documents shall apply at all times to members of academic
                        staff serving as Board members.</item>
                     <item n="H.03" xml:id="f2016-d1e3902">3. Academic staff, like other members of
                        the Board, are required to sign a “confidentiality agreement” and, to adhere
                        to the confidentiality policy outlined in Article 3 in the Board “Code of
                        Conduct”.</item>
                     <item n="H.04" xml:id="f2016-d1e3904">4. In any situation where ambiguity of
                        roles may exist, in interactions between members of academic staff serving
                        as Board members and Senior Academic Administrators, it is necessary for the
                        Board member and the administrator to be clear whether the Board member is
                        acting primarily as a member of the academic staff or as a governor. Where,
                        after consultation with the Member, the administrator remains uncertain as
                        to whether the Member is acting in his or her capacity as a Faculty Member
                        or a member of the Board, the administrator may ask the Member to declare in
                        writing and in a timely manner the capacity in which he or she is
                        acting.</item>
                     <item n="H.05" xml:id="f2016-d1e3906">5. Should a member of academic staff who
                        is a Board member grieve in his or her capacity as a member of academic
                        staff an alleged violation by the administration of the Faculty Handbook,
                        that Member shall declare to the Board Chair his or her potential conflict
                        of interest before the next meeting of the Board.</item>

               <p> 2.3 In the event that the day care facility is not in operation due to the

                  automatically deducted by the University from the remuneration paid to each

                  collective agreement between the University and the Faculty Association agree to
                  take such steps as may be required to give effect to these provisions, the
